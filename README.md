# JS Fundamentals

This project contains a series of beginner-friendly JavaScript exercises that helped me understand the core concepts of the language — from working with constants and variables to using loops, functions, and recursion. Each file demonstrates a specific skill that builds my foundation in Node.js and JavaScript syntax.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through these exercises, I learned how to:

* Declare constants using `const` instead of `var`
* Use `console.log()` to print output to the console
* Work with command-line arguments using `process.argv`
* Handle different conditions and control program flow
* Convert and validate data types (e.g., strings to integers)
* Use loops to repeat actions and work with arrays
* Define and call functions to make code reusable
* Write recursive functions to solve problems elegantly

Overall, this project taught me how to think logically, write cleaner code, and understand how JavaScript executes in the Node.js environment.

## 🗂️ Project Files and Explanations

### 0. **First constant, first print**

**File:** `0-javascript_is_amazing.js`
Learned how to declare a constant variable and print its value.
Introduced to `console.log()` and basic output.

---

### 1. **3 Languages**

**File:** `1-multi_languages.js`
Practiced printing multiple lines and using `console.log()` multiple times.

---

### 2. **Arguments**

**File:** `2-arguments.js`
Learned to use `process.argv` to handle command-line arguments and use conditional statements to display messages based on input count.

---

### 3. **Value of my argument**

**File:** `3-value_argument.js`
Learned to print the first argument passed to a script or show a default message if none is provided.

---

### 4. **Create a sentence**

**File:** `4-concat.js`
Practiced string concatenation and understanding how JavaScript handles `undefined` when an argument is missing.

---

### 5. **An Integer**

**File:** `5-to_integer.js`
Learned how to convert strings to integers using `Number()` and handle invalid numbers gracefully.

---

### 6. **Loop to languages**

**File:** `6-multi_languages_loop.js`
Used an array and a loop to print messages dynamically, reinforcing array iteration and loop logic.

---

### 7. **I love C**

**File:** `7-multi_c.js`
Practiced using loops and conditionals to print a message a specific number of times.

---

### 8. **Square**

**File:** `8-square.js`
Learned how to use nested loops to print a square pattern and handle missing or invalid input.

---

### 9. **Add**

**File:** `9-add.js`
Introduced to defining functions (`function add(a, b)`) and calling them to perform simple arithmetic operations.

---

### 10. **Factorial (Advanced)**

**File:** `10-factorial.js`
Learned recursion by computing factorials. Understood base cases, recursive calls, and how JavaScript handles large numbers.

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts Reinforced

* Variables and constants (`const`, `let`)
* Console output
* Command-line argument handling
* Conditionals (`if`, `else`)
* Loops (`for`, `while`)
* Functions and recursion
* Type conversion (`Number()`)
* Basic problem-solving in JavaScript

## ⚙️ How to Run

Each script can be executed using Node.js:

```bash
node filename.js
```

Example:

```bash
node 0-javascript_is_amazing.js
```

## 🏁 Conclusion

These exercises were a great way to get comfortable with JavaScript fundamentals and the Node.js environment. I now have a stronger grasp of writing scripts, working with input, and building logical solutions step by step.
